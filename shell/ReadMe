Welcome to my shell. 
In my shell, I was able to accomplish some of the goals set out by Instructor Freudenthal and Pruitt. Unfortunately not every goal was met. 
Firstly, I would like to say that although my shell can execute some of the commands/processes required by the assignment,
only the cd and dir commands were recognized by the tester. This assignment was challenging, but it helped me understand the importance of os processes.

To run my script, simply type ./shell.py and you can start inputting commands to my shell. To exit: Ctrl + D.
